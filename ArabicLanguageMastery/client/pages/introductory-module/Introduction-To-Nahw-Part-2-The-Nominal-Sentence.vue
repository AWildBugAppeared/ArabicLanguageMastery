        Nahw is the Arabic science which states how words can be grouped
        together in order to add additional meanings. We have already discussed
        the example of 'tall boy', where we have the word 'tall' conveying the
        meaning of height, the word 'boy' referring to an entity, and by placing
        them together in that order we create the descriptive phrase and
        associate the two entities together. Had we said 'boy tall' instead, we
        would have a meaningless phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building on this, in Arabic, Nahw (Grammar) revolves around two main
        issues, and we can say Nahw is entirely concerned with solving these two
        problems. This lesson will present these problems, and give an
        introduction into how Nahw solves these 2 problems.

      <h2>What is a sentence?</h2>
      <important-note>
        Phrases are when two or more words combine to create a beneficial
        meaning upon which silence <em>is not</em> appropriate. <br />

        Sentences are when two or more words combine to create a beneficial
        meaning upon which silence <em>is</em> appropriate.
      </important-note>

      <p>
        We have already mentioned that our favourite example, 'tall boy', is a
        phrase, because the listener has received a partial benefit. He knows
        what the information is, but does not know who we are speaking about. In
        grammar, the person/thing/entity that we are talking about is called the
        Subject <span class="arabic">مُسْنَد إْلَيْه</span>. The information we
        are conveying about the subject is called the Predicate
        <span class="arabic">مُسْنَد</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In English, the Subject of the sentence always comes first. I am tall. I
        went to the shop. I am studying Arabic. (Unless you are Yoda). But in
        Arabic, it is possible for the Predicate of a sentence to come first.
        This gives rise to 2 types of sentences in Arabic.
      </p>

      <h2 class="inline-heading">The Nominal Sentence -</h2>
      <span class="arabic">الْجُمْلَة الْإِسْمِيَّة</span>

      <p>
        The Nominal Sentence is what resembles the English sentence, in that the
        Subject comes first followed by the Predicate. A sentence will also
        either contain a verb, or it won't. In the case where the sentence
        contains a verb, the subect will always come first in a nominal
        sentence.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ مَشْهُوْرٌ</span>- The man is famous.
          <br />
          This is a nominal sentence without a verb.
          <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ</span> is the Subject, followed by the
          Predicate <span class="arabic">مَشْهُوْرٌ</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ ذَهَبَ</span>- The man went. <br />
          This is a nominal sentence with a verb.
          <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ</span> is the Subject, followed by the
          Predicate <span class="arabic">ذَهَبَ</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Problem with the Nominal Sentence</h3>

      <p>
        Take a close look at
        <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ مَشْهُوْرٌ</span> and compare it to
        <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ الْمَشْهُوْرُ</span>. 'The man is
        famous' vs 'the famous man'. The first is a sentence while the second is
        a phrase. You will also see that both have the same number of words.
        <span class="arabic">الرِّجَالُ</span> which means 'the man', and
        <span class="arabic">مَشْهُوْرٌ</span> which means famous. So where do
        we get the 'is' translation for the sentence?
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the fundamental issue with Nominal Sentences in Arabic. There is
        no word for 'is' which in English is used to separate between the
        Subject and the Predicate in a sentence. Instead, in Arabic it is
        assumed and understood and we add the word in when understanding. But we
        might get confused and miss the assumed 'is' and instead translate it as
        'the famous man'.
      </p>

      <p>So, how do we know where to place the 'is' in a nominal sentence?</p>

      <important-note>
        In a <span class="arabic">جُمْلَة إِسْمِيَّة</span> (nominal sentence),
        we place the 'is' when all the phrase level relationships end.
      </important-note>

      Let's take the sentence
      <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ الْمَشْهُوْرِ جَدِيْدٌ</span>. Zaid is
      the name of a person, <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ</span> means book,
      <span class="arabic">مَشْهُوْرٌ</span> means famous, and
      <span class="arabic">جَدِيْدٌ</span> means new. We have learned two types
      of phrases so far, <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span> and
      <span class="arabic">مضاف - مضاف إليه</span>. Let's assume for now that
      those are the only types of phrases in the language and apply our rule.

      <p>
        We ask ourselves, is there a phrase level relationship between the first
        two words
        <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ</span>? Let's try
        <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span>. For
        <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span> both parts need to match in
        definiteness, number, gender, and grammatical state. And the
        <span class="arabic">موصوف</span> needs to come before the
        <span class="arabic">صفة</span>. So automatically we can discount
        <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span> as the word
        <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ</span> comes before
        <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ</span>. We could even look at the
        meaning of both words and see that the Descriptive Phrase doesn't make
        sense here.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we try our next type of phrase,
        <span class="arabic">مضاف - مضاف إليه</span>. We know that the
        <span class="arabic">مضاف</span> needs to be free from both 'Al' and
        tanween. And we see that <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ</span> is missing
        both 'Al' and tanween. This tell-tale sign is a very good indication
        that we are dealing with a <span class="arabic">مضاف - مضاف إليه</span>,
        Possessive Phrase structure. We then notice that
        <span class="arabic">زَيْدٍ</span> is in the state of Jarr by way of
        it's Kasrah, fulfilling the condition of
        <span class="arabic">مضاف إليه</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, we will translate
        <span class="arabic">كِتَابُ زَيْدٍ</span> as 'The book of Zaid', or
        "Zaid's Book", and there will be no 'is' between the two words. We are
        still dealing with the <span class="arabic">مُسْنَد إْلَيْه</span>, the
        Subject, part of the sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ok so we move onto the next pair of words
        <span class="arabic">زَيْدٍ الْمَشْهُوْرِ</span> and we ask ourselves
        the same question. Is there a phrase level relationship between the two
        words?
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's try <span class="arabic">مضاف - مضاف إليه</span> again. We notice
        that <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرِ</span> ends in a Kasrah and so
        is in the state of Jarr fulfilling the condition of the
        <span class="arabic">مضاف إليه</span>. But when we take a look at
        <span class="arabic">زَيْدٍ</span> we notice that Zaid ends in
        Kasratain, it has a tanween, which means it cannot be a
        <span class="arabic">مضاف</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next we try <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span>. Do both words match
        in all 4 categories? Definiteness, number, gender, grammatical state?
        Well they are both definite. Zaid is the name of a person, and
        <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرِ</span> has 'Al' making it definite.
        They both end in Kasrah which reflects their Jarr state. Zaid is
        masculine, and <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرِ</span> does not end in
        the 'round taa' of femininity <span class="arabic">ة</span> which means
        it is also masculine. It is also singular. As all 4 conditions are
        matched, we can label this as a Descriptive Phrase
        <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span>. The translation so far would then
        be, 'The book of famous Zaid....' or "Famous Zaid's book...."
      </p>

      <note>
        This is a reminder once again not to worry about how to determine the
        gender and plurality of a word. These are topics that require more
        discussion and so for now, it is enough to know that one way of making a
        word feminine is by adding <span class="arabic">تَاء مَرْبُوْطَة</span>,
        The Taa of Femininity, <span class="arabic">ة</span> at the end of a
        word.
        <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرَةُ &#x2192; الْمَشْهُوْرُ</span>. And
        one way of making a word plural is by giving it an
        <span class="arabic">-ُوْنَ</span> ending.
        <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرُوْنَ &#x2192; الْمَشْهُوْرُ</span>
        (this only applies when the entity being described is a human).
      </note>

      <p>
        Finally we only have one pair of words left
        <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرِ جَدِيْدٌ</span>. By process of
        elimination, we already know the 'is' must be in between these two
        words. But let's assume There were more words upcoming and see how we
        could still determine that this is the correct place to insert the 'is'.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process is actually quite quick. We can automatically see it can't
        be <span class="arabic">مضاف - مضاف إليه</span> since the
        <span class="arabic">الْمَشْهُوْرِ</span> has an 'Al', preventing it
        from being a <span class="arabic">مضاف</span>. And the two words can't
        form a <span class="arabic">موصوف صفة</span> relationship because they
        don't match in either definiteness or state. One is definite because it
        has 'Al', and the other is indefinite because it has tanween. One is
        <span class="arabic">مجرور</span> reflected by Kasrah, and one is
        <span class="arabic">مرفوع</span>
        reflected by Dammah.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we have exhausted all of the phrase level relationships, that is
        where we will 'drop' the is. Our final translation then is: 'The book of
        famous Zaid is new', or 'Famous Zaid's book is new'.
      </p>

          <li>
            A sentence comprises of two parts. The
            <span class="arabic">مُسْنَد إْلَيْه</span> which is the subject of
            the sentence, the primary portion of the sentence, and the
            <span class="arabic">مُسْنَد</span>, the predicate of the sentence,
            which conveys some information about the subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Arabic there are two types of sentences. When the Subject
            <span class="arabic">مُسْنَد إْلَيْه</span> comes first, we are
            dealing with a Nominal Sentence
            <span class="arabic">جُمْلَة إِسْمِيَّة</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a Nominal Sentence, because Arabic has no word for 'is', we have
            a problem in identifying where the subject ends and when the
            predicate begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            The solution is to insert the word 'is' when all the phrase level
            relationships end. We compare pairs of words and see if they have a
            phrase level relationship. If they don't, that is where the subject
            ends and the predicate begins.
